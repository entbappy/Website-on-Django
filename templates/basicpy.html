                    <h1 id="about-python">About Python</h1>
                    <p>Python is one of those rare languages which can claim to be both <em>simple</em> and
                        <em>powerful</em>. You will find yourself pleasantly surprised to see how easy it is to
                        concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the syntax and structure of the language
                        you are programming in.</p>
                    <p>The official introduction to Python is:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data
                            structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python&apos;s
                            elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal
                            language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>I will discuss most of these features in more detail in the next section.</p>
                    <h2 id="story-behind-the-name">Story behind the name</h2>
                    <p>Guido van Rossum, the creator of the Python language, named the language after the BBC show
                        &quot;Monty
                        Python&apos;s Flying Circus&quot;. He doesn&apos;t particularly like snakes that kill animals
                        for food by winding
                        their long bodies around them and crushing them.</p>
                    <h2 id="features-of-python">Features of Python</h2>
                    <h3 id="simple">Simple</h3>
                    <p>Python is a simple and minimalistic language. Reading a good Python program feels almost like
                        reading English, although very strict English! This pseudo-code nature of Python is one of its
                        greatest strengths. It allows you to concentrate on the solution to the problem rather than the
                        language itself.</p>
                    <h3 id="easy-to-learn">Easy to Learn</h3>
                    <p>As you will see, Python is extremely easy to get started with. Python has an extraordinarily
                        simple syntax, as already mentioned.</p>
                    <h3 id="free-and-open-source">Free and Open Source</h3>
                    <p>Python is an example of a <em>FLOSS</em> (Free/Libr&#xE9; and Open Source Software). In simple
                        terms, you can freely distribute copies of this software, read its source code, make changes to
                        it, and use pieces of it in new free programs. FLOSS is based on the concept of a community
                        which shares knowledge. This is one of the reasons why Python is so good - it has been created
                        and is constantly improved by a community who just want to see a better Python.</p>
                    <h3 id="high-level-language">High-level Language</h3>
                    <p>When you write programs in Python, you never need to bother about the low-level details such as
                        managing the memory used by your program, etc.</p>
                    <h3 id="portable">Portable</h3>
                    <p>Due to its open-source nature, Python has been ported to (i.e. changed to make it work on) many
                        platforms. All your Python programs can work on any of these platforms without requiring any
                        changes at all if you are careful enough to avoid any system-dependent features.</p>
                    <p>You can use Python on GNU/Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Macintosh, Solaris, OS/2, Amiga, AROS, AS/400,
                        BeOS, OS/390, z/OS, Palm OS, QNX, VMS, Psion, Acorn RISC OS, VxWorks, PlayStation, Sharp Zaurus,
                        Windows CE and PocketPC!</p>
                    <p>You can even use a platform like <a href="http://kivy.org" target="_blank">Kivy</a> to create
                        games for your computer <em>and</em> for iPhone, iPad, and Android.</p>
                    <h3 id="interpreted">Interpreted</h3>
                    <p>This requires a bit of explanation.</p>
                    <p>A program written in a compiled language like C or C++ is converted from the source language i.e.
                        C or C++ into a language that is spoken by your computer (binary code i.e. 0s and 1s) using a
                        compiler with various flags and options. When you run the program, the linker/loader software
                        copies the program from hard disk to memory and starts running it.</p>
                    <p>Python, on the other hand, does not need compilation to binary. You just <em>run</em> the program
                        directly from the source code. Internally, Python converts the source code into an intermediate
                        form called bytecodes and then translates this into the native language of your computer and
                        then runs it. All this, actually, makes using Python much easier since you don&apos;t have to
                        worry about compiling the program, making sure that the proper libraries are linked and loaded,
                        etc. This also makes your Python programs much more portable, since you can just copy your
                        Python program onto another computer and it just works!</p>
                    <h3 id="object-oriented">Object Oriented</h3>
                    <p>Python supports procedure-oriented programming as well as object-oriented programming. In
                        <em>procedure-oriented</em> languages, the program is built around procedures or functions which
                        are nothing but reusable pieces of programs. In <em>object-oriented</em> languages, the program
                        is built around objects which combine data and functionality. Python has a very powerful but
                        simplistic way of doing OOP, especially when compared to big languages like C++ or Java.</p>
                    <h3 id="extensible">Extensible</h3>
                    <p>If you need a critical piece of code to run very fast or want to have some piece of algorithm not
                        to be open, you can code that part of your program in C or C++ and then use it from your Python
                        program.</p>
                    <h3 id="embeddable">Embeddable</h3>
                    <p>You can embed Python within your C/C++ programs to give <em>scripting</em> capabilities for your
                        program&apos;s users.</p>
                    <h3 id="extensive-libraries">Extensive Libraries</h3>
                    <p>The Python Standard Library is huge indeed. It can help you do various things involving regular
                        expressions,documentation generation, unit testing, threading, databases, web browsers, CGI,
                        FTP, email, XML, XML-RPC, HTML, WAV files, cryptography, GUI (graphical user interfaces), and
                        other system-dependent stuff. Remember, all this is always available wherever Python is
                        installed. This is called the <em>Batteries Included</em> philosophy of Python.</p>
                    <p>Besides the standard library, there are various other high-quality libraries which you can find
                        at the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi" target="_blank">Python Package Index</a>.</p>
                    <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
                    <p>Python is indeed an exciting and powerful language. It has the right combination of performance
                        and features that make writing programs in Python both fun and easy.</p>
                    <h2 id="python-3-versus-2">Python 3 versus 2</h2>
                    <p>You can ignore this section if you&apos;re not interested in the difference between &quot;Python
                        version 2&quot; and &quot;Python version 3&quot;. But please do be aware of which version you
                        are using. This book is written for Python version 3.</p>
                    <p>Remember that once you have properly understood and learn to use one version, you can easily
                        learn the differences and use the other one. The hard part is learning programming and
                        understanding the basics of Python language itself. That is our goal in this book, and once you
                        have achieved that goal, you can easily use Python 2 or Python 3 depending on your situation.
                    </p>

                    <p>You may find it interesting to read what great hackers like ESR have to say about Python:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Eric S. Raymond</em> is the author of &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; and is
                            also the person who coined the term <em>Open Source</em>. He says that <a
                                href="http://www.python.org/about/success/esr/" target="_blank">Python has become his
                                favorite programming language</a>. This article was the real inspiration for my first
                            brush with Python.</li>
                        <li><em>Bruce Eckel</em> is the author of the famous &apos;Thinking in Java&apos; and
                            &apos;Thinking in C++&apos; books. He says that no language has made him more productive
                            than Python. He says that Python is perhaps the only language that focuses on making things
                            easier for the programmer. Read the <a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/aboutme.html"

                        <li><em>Peter Norvig</em> is a well-known Lisp author and Director of Search Quality at Google
                            (thanks to Guido van Rossum for pointing that out). He says that <a
                                href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1803815" target="_blank">writing Python is
                                like writing in pseudocode</a>. He says that Python has always been an integral part of
                            Google. You can actually verify this statement by looking at the <a
